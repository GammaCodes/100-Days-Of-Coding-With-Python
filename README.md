# 100 Days of Code: Python Projects Showcase

Welcome to my **100 Days of Code** journey! This repository will be home to the projects I complete as part of the **[100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code)**, taught by Dr. Angela Yu.

## About the Course

This course is designed to help learners master Python through hands-on projects, covering a wide range of topics such as automation, web development, game development, and data science. With over **60+ hours** of content, I'll be building **100 real-world projects** as I progress from a beginner to a professional Python developer.

Throughout the course, I will work with tools and technologies such as:

- **Python 3**
- **Data Science** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn)
- **Web Scraping** (BeautifulSoup, Selenium)
- **Web Development** (Flask, REST APIs, SQL, SQLite, PostgreSQL)
- **Automation** (Task automation with Python)
- **Game Development** (Python Turtle)
- **Version Control** (Git, GitHub)

- **LinkedIn Auto Job Applications** using Selenium
- **Tinder Auto Swiper** 
- **Snake Game** 
- **Fully Fledged Blog Website** 
- **Data Science Projects** analyzing trends with real-world datasets

Stay tuned for updates!
